739,1377646,enhancement,Database recreation listener logic is wrong,Firefox for iOS,Data Storage,RESOLVED,FIXED,2018-01-26 11:27:05,1377646,i noticed that several times i ve been left with partial bookmarks or partial history in my main firefox profile   the only way this can happen is if two things occur      the database is moved recreated     the sync timestamps are not reset   this used to be impossible  in the course of initializing the profile we would create a browsersyncmanager  and it would listen to reset notifications and do the right thing   these days browserprofile init is eager  it eagerly creates browserdb    which tries to create the schema table  which can trigger the database replacement logic   browsersyncmanager observes ondatabasewasrecreated  but browsersyncmanager takes a profile as an init argument   if the database is moved out of the way during the init of browserprofile  there will be no browsersyncmanager listening for the database recreation logic  and we will be left with partial sync data   the fix is to somehow ensure that the correct sync related code runs if the db needs to be recovered  perhaps via a flag in profile  or by rearranging the init of browsersyncmanager   it s also necessary to detect this state and recover — perhaps by checking for a  bak file  once  and re syncing the appropriate database ,
