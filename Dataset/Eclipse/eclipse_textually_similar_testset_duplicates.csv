candidate of eclipse        when i tried to launch it after the installation it crashes with the attached report  the reason is that eclipse by itself tries to run with java    which i have installed on my system but which is not the default  when i type  java  version  in a shell i get java   and not    the fact that eclipse uses java   instead results in several noclassdeffounderrors due to classes which were removed in java    to my opinion eclipse should by default use the default java of a system and should not try to find the highest version especially if this is still an ea version

564700.0,Platform,IDE,CLOSED,DUPLICATE,Autocomplete feature issue,2020-07-01 04:41:14,0.06063798689634026,hello   i am not sure if my issue is related to bug     but i am getting the issue in autocomplete feature of recent version of eclipse  example   if i create a hashmap   hashmap map   new hashmap   now to put the data  i say map  then it shows the list of available methods  it is fine but when i type map put then it shows list of methods having  put  in their names with  compute  as selected one   due to this as soon as i press  enter   compute  method is written   when there is exact method with name  put  then why it expects me select that name from the list explicitly  rather if there is method with that name exactly then it should be selected by default  so this behaviour slows down typing of code  please suggest ,564305.0

has gotten slower and slower to reach an unbearable speed for my projects  for instance  it is not possible to compile this project with eclipse in finite time        i ve reported bugs in the past like this one    bug cgi id    most of those bugs deal with the management of generic types and their type bounds by the eclipse compiler  with a recent version  things seem to have gotten worse as there is now a cache that grows to bigsizes   org eclipse jdt internal compiler lookup typesystem hashedparameterizedtypes hashedparameterizedtypes  i have placed a breakpoint in  org eclipse jdt internal compiler lookup typesystem hashedparameterizedtypes get  to look at the size of that hashedparameterizedtypes hashmap  when randomly stopping to see the size  i ve observed sizes of    before they are levelled again  e g  by a typesystem reset  call or by a new typesystem creation    tostring  ing the hashmap entries in the debugger at random points shows that the  same  type is often repeated  for example                                                                                                    unresolved type java util function todoublefunction   super t   lorg eclipse

                                  so  the keys often look the same but they re different instances  looking at the internalparameterizedtypebinding equals  method  i can say that in the above example     type are the same instance   enclosingtype are null   arguments are different arrays with the  same  content    but different instances  so the equals  check fails  instances are always wildcardbinding with different bound instance and id values  the difference being that in wildcardbinding bound declaringelement  a different methodbinding is referenced  e g
