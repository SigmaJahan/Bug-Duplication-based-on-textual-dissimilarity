18,483383,Equinox,p2,RESOLVED,FIXED,Allow p2 to prevent installation of IUs requiring an Execution Environment not compatible with running JRE,2015-12-01T15:06:54Z,it should not be possible to install features that require an execution environment that is not supported by the jre currently running eclipse   or  if for reasons i don t see  there should a t least be a warning   for example  when running the eclipse platform sdk on a jre     and installing a feature whose plug ins require jre      the installation succeeds  but after restarting eclipse it seems as if the feature wasn t installed  none of the contributions which the plug ins are meant to provide are visible  see here     for the full story   the reason  of course  is that the bundles aren t started due to the unresolved requirement  but it takes some time and forth and back to find out what the reason is for the just installed plug ins not showing up  less patient or experienced users will likely just give up          ,
19,428088,EMF,Core,CLOSED,FIXED,"Support generating @since, @deprecated and @Deprecated",2014-02-13T11:18:53Z,in an environment that requires  since tags in the code    emf based generated code requires those  since tags  as well   currently  it is possible to add the  since tags to the genmodel  documentation   however  they will only be generated to getter methods  not setters   so  you have to manually edit the generated code  but that might not be applicable   for instance  if the code is not checked in and instead regenerated  or if your team decides that it s generally not a good idea to manually change generated code     suggestion  generate the documentation information not only into the getter s jdoc but also into the setter s jdoc   alternatively  please provide an option to generate  since tags ,

440,500783,Equinox,Compendium,RESOLVED,FIXED,[http] Content input stream unavailable for form based requests in Neon,2016-09-02T21:04:17Z,i have a jetty based proxy   that is failing to proxy requests with form based content   because the httpservletrequest inputstream has already been consumed by the time the servlet s service  method is called and so when the proxy attempts to copy the post content to the proxy request  there is nothing to read   the requests contain both url query parameters and form parameters   this used to work fine in mars   i tried debugging this a bit and what seems to have changed is that in the code below from org eclipse equinox http server internal context dispatchtargets  querystring is now always null even when there are query args in the request url   public void addrequestparameters     if       parametermap   request getparametermap     querystring   request getquerystring     return      this is  because the dispatchtargets instance is now always constructed with a null querystring arg   tracing it back  the query string arg is null because the path info that org eclipse equinox http servlet internal httpserviceruntimeimpl getdispatchtargets  attempts to extract the query args from was obtained in httpservletrequestwrapperimpl getdispatchpathinfo  using the httpservletrequest getpathinfo  method which does not contain any query args   regardless of whether or not this is a bug  it s evident that proxying the request would still fail if the url indeed had no query args   i think it s fine for for the servlet container to process the form parameters prior to calling the servlet s service method  but the post data should still be accessible to the servlet in case it needs it for other purposes   ,

471,494735,Oomph,Setup,RESOLVED,FIXED,Eclipse Installer does not create .desktop file for the menu,2016-05-27T10:27:35Z,created attachment   example of a  desktop launcher   when you use the eclipse installer on ubuntu  users expect to find eclipse in the menu after installation   however  the installer does not create a  desktop file  so it is not possible to have an icon in the launch bar nor in the menu   the installer should create an eclipse desktop file in the eclipse installation folder  so we can use it as a launcher and lock it in the launch bar   then  to have eclipse in the menu  it should also create a  desktop file in     local share applications  attachment is an example of a  desktop i did for my eclipse installation  the  desktop file must be executable ,
